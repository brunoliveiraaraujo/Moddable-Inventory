## Thanks

Thanks to Matt Gambell from Game Dev Guide on Youtube (<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR35rzd4LLomtQout93gi0w>) for his video tutorials on Unity UI, of which his video on Creating a Custom Tab System in Unity (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=211t6r12XPQ>) was of great help on building the Inventory Tab System present in the Demo of this software.
